 Face Recognition and Laser Positioning System
This project integrates the implementation of Haar cascades classifiers for facial recognition, enabling the detection and positioning of a human face within a live video feed. This data is then processed using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller through an Arduino system. The PID controller facilitates the precise adjustment of a servo motor, which in turn directs the laser pointer to accurately track and follow the recognized face's movements. While its primary purpose remains recreational or experimental, this sophisticated system could have diverse applications, such as interactive displays, robotics, or as a foundational technology for advancing human-computer interaction systems. Adhering to safety protocols and ensuring precise calibration are crucial considerations for the successful and secure operation of this integrated system.
